rtl8188ce-linux-driver
======================


This slightly modified version of the driver fixes some issues with RealTek cards on Linux.  It also fixes a bug with ignoring CRDA restrictions


Well supported RealTek cards:

        RTL8188CE
        RTL8192CE
        
Well supported kernel releases:

        3.2.x
        3.8.x
        3.11.x

Well supported Ubuntu releases:

        Ubuntu 12.04
        Ubuntu 13.04
        Ubuntu 13.10


Other RealTek cards, kernel releases, and Linux flavors/releases are supported, but not tested by me (since I don't have them/use them).  From the original readme file:

--This driver supports following RealTek PCIE Wireless LAN NICs:

        RTL8188CE/RTL8192CE
        RTL8191SE/RTL8192SE
        RTL8192DE
        RTL8723AE
        RTL8188EE

--This driver supports following Linux OSes:

        Fedora Core
        Debian
        Mandriva
        Open SUSE
        Gentoo
        MeeGo
        android 2.2 (froyo-x86), etc.
        

Please note though that I have only tested the driver on Ubuntu, though I know it does compile on Fedora 17.  If you are NOT using Ubuntu, pay close attention to your kernel version when selecting branches.  You also need to substitute your package manager whenever you see "apt-get install", so Fedora would be "yum install xxx".  Most package names are the same but there may be some difference.


To check your kernel version:  

    uname -r


Instructions to install:

Note:  These instructions were verified on Ubuntu 13.04 running kernel 3.8.0-27-generic #40 and on Ubuntu 13.10 running kernel 3.11

Some instructions can be found here:  http://www.perseosblog.com/en/posts/solving-connection-problem-with-realtek-wifi-card-rtl8188ce-rtl8192ce-rtl8191se-and-rtl8192de-on-debian-ubuntu-and-derivatives/

These commands should be typed in an open terminal.  I recommend you start in your home directory by typing "cd"

0\.  Clone this git repository:

Install git if necessary:

    sudo apt-get install git

Clone the repo (Basically it makes a copy of the current source code)

    git clone https://github.com/FreedomBen/rtl8188ce-linux-driver.git

1\.  Install build dependencies (pay attention to the backticks!):

    apt-get install gcc build-essential linux-headers-generic linux-headers-`uname -r`

2\. (Skip unless your first build attempt fails) -> Make sure you are on the correct branch for your kernel version.  The branches are named after Ubuntu releases to which they commonly apply, but the most important factor is not the version of Ubuntu, it is the kernel version.  There is a script called "verify_branch" that will help you find the right branch based on your kernel version.  When you run "make", the script "verify_branch" will be automatically called for you.  It will recommend to you the best branch for your kernel version.  If you tried the recommended branch and your build failed, you may need to try a different one.  If so, decline the offer to automatically switch branches for you.

If you need to, you can switch to the correct branch with:

    git checkout <branch>
    
Ex: "git checkout ubuntu-13.04"

    Release ver. | *Kernel ver.   |  Branch Name
    --------------------------------------------
    Ubuntu 12.04 | Kernel 3.2.x:  |  ubuntu-12.04
    Ubuntu 13.04 | Kernel 3.8.x:  |  ubuntu-13.04
    Ubuntu 13.10 | Kernel 3.11.x: |  ubuntu-13.10

    * Note, if the Ubuntu release ver and your kernel ver conflict, go with the branch corresponding to your *kernel version*!


3\. Compile:

    make

4\. Remove existing kernel modules.  You may want to write these down before moving just in case.  Record the output of "lsmod | grep ^rtl" (pay attention to the backticks!):

    modprobe -r `lsmod | grep ^rtl`

5\. Install:

    make install

6\. Modprobe in the new driver:

    modprobe rtl8192ce 

(This is the driver for rtl8188ce also)


7\. You may need to modprobe back in the other modules too (I did).  Mine were: 

    rtl8192ce, rtlwifi, and rtl8192c_common

8\. Make persistent by adding this to the end of /etc/modules:

    rtl8192ce.ko

You may want to verify your CRDA domain.  For example if you were in Bolivia it would be: "iw reg set BO"
